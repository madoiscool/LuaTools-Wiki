# Community Compatibility List

This directory contains JSON files for game compatibility information submitted by the community.

## How to Contribute

1. Create a new JSON file named using the Steam App ID (e.g., `123456.json` where `123456` is the Steam App ID)
2. Follow the example structure below
3. Submit a pull request

**File Naming**: Use the format `{appId}.json` (e.g., `730.json` for Counter-Strike 2)

**Automation**: The `all-games.json` file is automatically generated by a GitHub Action when you push changes. You don't need to manually update it! The workflow will:
- Run automatically on push to `main`
- Aggregate all individual JSON files into `all-games.json`
- Commit the changes automatically

**Note**: The `all-games.json` file is an aggregated file containing all games in a single array. This allows the website to fetch all compatibility data in a single request without hitting GitHub API rate limits.

**Local Testing**: You can test the aggregation locally by running:
```bash
npm run aggregate-games
```
